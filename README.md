# Algor√≠tmica

This repo contains my assignments for the algorithmic subject. 

* [Efficiency](https://github.com/yabirgb/algoritmica/tree/master/eficiencia) - Check how different algorithms compare in 
efficency and how we can appreciate the results of Big O notation and the theorical analysis. Boring, but I did a couple 
of scripts in bash and python that automatization all the process and made it a bit funnier.
